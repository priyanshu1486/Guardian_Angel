GUARDIAN ANGEL
Women's safety refers to protecting women from violence, harassment, and discrimination in all areas of life â€” at home, in public spaces, at work, and online. It includes creating safe environments, enforcing laws against abuse, promoting gender equality, and empowering women to speak up and seek help. Ensuring women's safety is essential for building a fair, healthy, and strong society.
